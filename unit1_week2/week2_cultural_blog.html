					<h2> March 22nd, 2014</h2>
					<p>When I think of the happiest I've ever been in my life, the values that come to mind would be: Achievement, Confidence, Creativity, Focus, and Self-respect. Mainly because the happiest I've ever been is after I achieve a major goal in my life, such as graduating high school and college. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>Of these values, I would say that confidence is the  most important to me primarily because it is the hardest for me to maintain, especially when facing challenges that test my knowledge, physical and emotional endurance, and willpower. When I am confident in myself, I find that most tasks are relatively easy to accomplish because I know that I will have the ability and tenacity to complete them, even if I make mistakes on the way. On the other hand, when I am not confident in my ability to do something, it is extremely difficult to make any progress at all because I am overtaken by the fear of failing and making mistakes. Confidence doesn't really come naturally for me, and (as weird as it seems) I sometimes have to trick myself into being confident in myself so that I can learn from my mistakes, instead of being so overwhelmed that I just quit and stop trying at all. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>
						In general, I try to live up to these values:
						</br>
						</br>
						Disagree 1---2---3---<strong style="background-color:red">4</strong>---5 Agree
						</br>
						</br>
						I gave myself a rating of 4 for maintaining these values because while I do my best to be confident in myself and remain focused on my goals, sometimes it is very hard to do.
					</p>
				</br>
					<p>
						The last topic that somebody asked me for advice on was hardware for building a custom computer. I have built several computers for myself and friends which all ended up working great, so most of my friends ask me for advice on this subject.

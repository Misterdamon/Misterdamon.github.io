					<h2> Pairing and Feedback </h2>
						<h3> Pairing </h3>
					<p>
					 Overall, I truly enjoy doing the pairing sessions for DBC phase 0 for a variety of reasons. First, I like that I am constantly getting a second opinion on what code I'm working on and how I am implementing it. Second, it's always nice working with other people because I always learn something new from them, even if it is just a different way of doing something that I already knew how to do. 
					</p>
					<p>
					 I especially enjoyed working on some of the harder challenges with my pairs, mainly because we were both able to contribute our knowledge to the problem. There was one session in particular where we worked on a regular expression (even though it was later removed from the challenge) that would match a certain pattern of characters. It took us a while of researching and really looking into the regex docs to know where to start, but as we went along both of us became more comfortable with the problem and we eventually figured it out. It was a combined effort that produced a positive result, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. 
					 </br>
					 </br>
					 The only part that I find somewhat difficult is the formal driver/navigator system because I find it hard to very clearly determine who is navigating and who is the driver at a certain point. To me it seems like both pairs are constantly switching between driver and navigator as the session goes on and as each person has something else to contribute. While I see the benefit of the more formal driver/navigator system, I just find it a bit hard to determine if I'm doing it right.
					</p>

					<h3> Receiving Feedback </h3>
					<p>
						As of today, I actually haven't received any feedback on my pairing sessions, either because it wasn't rated yet, or it wasn't kind, specific, and actionable. So, I don't really know how I feel when receiving feedback, but I will just have to remember that if the feedback does have something negative, I shouldn't take it as an insult or as an obstacle but rather as an opportunity to work on something that could use improvement. 
					</p>
					<h3> Giving Feedback </h3>
					<p>
					I find that writing good feedback is extremely diffcult, mainly because it is hard to put in a form that will be useful to the other person. I try to at least include one thing that the other person could work on, just so that I'm not writing a bunch of useless information that can't actually be acted upon. It is pretty hard to write feedback that is kind, specific, and actionable because most of my sessions have gone very well and I haven't really had many issues to cover in my feedback. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>
					In general, I think that using pairing and feedback is a great way to learn programming and have loved doing the sessions so far. I believe it greatly improves my ability to express my thoughts and communicate effectively about programming concepts. I look forward to pairing in unit 2!

					<h2> March 22nd, 2014</h2>
					<p>When I think of the happiest I've ever been in my life, the values that come to mind would be: Achievement, Confidence, Creativity, Focus, and Self-respect. Mainly because the happiest I've ever been is after I achieve a major goal in my life, such as graduating high school and college. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>Of these values, I would say that confidence is the  most important to me primarily because it is the hardest for me to maintain, especially when facing challenges that test my knowledge, physical and emotional endurance, and willpower. When I am confident in myself, I find that most tasks are relatively easy to accomplish because I know that I will have the ability and tenacity to complete them, even if I make mistakes on the way. On the other hand, when I am not confident in my ability to do something, it is extremely difficult to make any progress at all because I am overtaken by the fear of failing and making mistakes. Confidence doesn't really come naturally for me, and (as weird as it seems) I sometimes have to trick myself into being confident in myself so that I can learn from my mistakes, instead of being so overwhelmed that I just quit and stop trying at all. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>
						In general, I try to live up to these values:
						</br>
						</br>
						Disagree 1---2---3---<strong style="background-color:red">4</strong>---5 Agree
						</br>
						</br>
						I gave myself a rating of 4 for maintaining these values because while I do my best to be confident in myself and remain focused on my goals, sometimes it is very hard to do.
					</p>
				</br>
					<p>
						The last topic that somebody asked me for advice on was hardware for building a custom computer. I have built several computers for myself and friends which all ended up working great, so most of my friends ask me for advice on this subject.

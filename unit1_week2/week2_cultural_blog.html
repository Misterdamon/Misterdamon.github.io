					<h2> Stereotype Threat </h2>

					<p> Hey everyone, </br> </p>

					<p> I can't really remember any specific time where I have felt the stereotype threat, at least in the sense of reinforcing a negative stereotype. The only situation that I can think of that comes close to stereotype threat is when thinking of how I fit in with my own family. I come from a family of eight children, all of which seem to have some amazing thing that they've done that makes them stand out from the rest. My dad is a doctor with an MD and a Ph.D, one of my brothers is a self-taught programmer who now is a lead engineer at a big-name company, one of my sisters is an organizer for major philanthropic events, another brother is serving two years in the Peace Corps in Senegal, and the list goes on... The trouble is that I always find that I have trouble putting myself on the list of outstanding citizens of humanity.</p>

					<p> While I was in college, I literally had NO idea what I wanted to do, and had no idea what I would eventually end up doing with my life. This can be a daunting feeling when you grow up in a family that expects success and achievement, and I really had a hard time trying to figure out where I belonged in relation to what my family expected and what I expected for myself. After a while, I got into the mindset that I may never be able to live up to their expectations and be the 'good son' that everyone expected me to be. So... I just stopped trying-I stopped studying, I stopped believing in myself, I stopped caring in general. This obviously had a drastic effect on my academic work and I became reclusive to the point where I hardly left my apartment. 
					</p>

					<p> It wasn't until I eventually finished college that I finally snapped out of this self-destructive pattern. I realized that I was setting these expectations on my own... I had created a stereotype for myself that expected me to be successful according to the desires of others. Ultimately, I was setting myself up for failure by comparing myself to everyone else in my family because I couldn't get past the idealistic notion that I was going to be an ideal son who did everything right and never made any mistakes. Luckily, I finally grew beyond this stereotype as I realized that it didn't matter what other people expected of me, that my life was my own and that I didn't have to set unrealistic expectations for myself just to feel like I was a part of the family. Now, I do things for the sole purpose of bettering myself, without thinking about how they line up with my family's expectations, and honestly, I have never felt better. 
					</p>

					<p> In general, anyone who believes they belong to a stereotype that is expected to perform in a certain way is just limiting themself. The only way forward from there is to break that stereotype and move on knowing that your life is in your own hands, and that your actions determine the course of your life. Anyways, thanks for letting me bare my soul publicly, and I'll see you all next week!

				<h2> Evolution of Tech</h2>

				<p> Hey everyone, </br> </p>

				<p>This time I'll be talking about some of the problems facing the tech world, and why they are important to us. The problem I'd like to illuminate is the fact that tech seems to always be getting more and more complicated as programming languages and techniques evolve. While innovation and development are not harmful by themselves, it seems as though programming languages are always being phased out by newer and better ways of solving problems and implementing features. I mean, I've been learning ruby for a few months now, but I have to resist the tendency to think that ruby will always be around, or that future languages will be similar to it. While it is useful today, I know that I will have to learn other languages and techniques just to keep up with the times. </p>

				<p> Like I said, innovation is not a bad thing by itself; yet, a problem arises when developers get stuck in the same mode of thinking, or refuse to move on to other languages because they are too comfortable with the way things are being done currently. I've been reading a lot about this sort of developer, and am doing my best to not get caught in the trap of doing only what I'm comfortable with. </p>
				<p>I take a lot of lessons from my oldest brother, who is a self-taught programmer who now has a very successful job as a lead engineer for a big-name company. One of the main problems he is always talking about is how some of the developers that he works with are too prideful/uncomfortable/lazy to learn new languages and continue to develop their programming skills because everything up until now has been easy for them to do. (And they make good money doing it) The only way my brother survived in the tech industry was because he was always willing to learn new languages and techniques. As far as I can tell, the only way to solve this issue is be vigilant so as to not fall behind on what is current. Ultimately, as technology evolves, developers must evolve with it or be left behind as some relic of the past.

				<h2> Emotional Conflict </h2>
				<p> When I think of the greatest emotional conflicts in my life, I believe the one that was hardest for me to deal with was during college. It wasn't a conflict with another person that affected me the most, but more a conflict with myself and my own emotions. While I was at college at UC Davis, I spent about two years as a computer science major before ultimately switching majors. The first few classes seemed easy enough to complete, but as I went through I realized that programming was much harder for me to grasp than I previously anticipated. The farther I got into the computer science classes, the more overwhelmed I became by the difficulty and scope of the subject. I began to fall behind because I stumbled into a vicious cycle of failing, and then blaming myself and my abilities for these failures. It became so bad that I would try to write and program, and if I wasn't successful on my first few tries, then I would just give up and retreat back into my comfort zone. 
				</p>
				<p>
				My strategy for dealing with shame is to retreat into something that I am comfortable with and to only do what I <em>know</em> I can accomplish. This, unfortunately, is an incredibly limiting perspective. With most other subjects, I never had to really try to understand them, so as soon as I was faced with something that I had to actually put in effort to understand, I would just give up and tell myself that I couldn't do it, or that I didn't <em>want</em> to do it. 
				</p>
				<p>
				This mindset dominated my life during college, and I failed to see the relationship between the amount of work that I put in, and my ability to understand something. Needless to say, my strategy for dealing with shame only made my emotional conflict worse, because I was too afraid to go back to what was so hard for me to deal with. I spent the remainder of my college experience working toward a degree in Comparative Literature because it was easy for me to understand, and I never had to go outside of my comfort zone. It wasn't until about 6 months ago that I snapped out of my cycle of shame and self-blame. I woke up one day with the realization that I didn't want to just be comfortable with my life, I wanted to feel like I tried and succeeded at something. (Also, a job that pays well is a bonus) I started viewing my failures as mere stepping stones on the road to my ultimate understanding of what I was doing. I wanted more and expected myself to be better, no matter how many times I failed. This is what eventually drove me to enroll in DBC, because now I am prepared to work hard and fail repeatedly in order to better myself as a whole.
				</p>
				<p> To be honest, if I could go back, I wouldn't do anything differently because I believe that my past is what helped shape me into the person I am today. If I didn't have that experience in college, I might not have the same drive to succeed and desire to surpass the close-mindedness that I previously adhered to. It is the contrast between the person I used to be and the person I am today that drives me to be better now.

					<h2> Pairing and Feedback </h2>
						<h3> Pairing </h3>
					<p>
					 Overall, I truly enjoy doing the pairing sessions for DBC phase 0 for a variety of reasons. First, I like that I am constantly getting a second opinion on what code I'm working on and how I am implementing it. Second, it's always nice working with other people because I always learn something new from them, even if it is just a different way of doing something that I already knew how to do. 
					</p>
					<p>
					 I especially enjoyed working on some of the harder challenges with my pairs, mainly because we were both able to contribute our knowledge to the problem. There was one session in particular where we worked on a regular expression (even though it was later removed from the challenge) that would match a certain pattern of characters. It took us a while of researching and really looking into the regex docs to know where to start, but as we went along both of us became more comfortable with the problem and we eventually figured it out. It was a combined effort that produced a positive result, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. 
					 </br>
					 </br>
					 The only part that I find somewhat difficult is the formal driver/navigator system because I find it hard to very clearly determine who is navigating and who is the driver at a certain point. To me it seems like both pairs are constantly switching between driver and navigator as the session goes on and as each person has something else to contribute. While I see the benefit of the more formal driver/navigator system, I just find it a bit hard to determine if I'm doing it right.
					</p>

					<h3> Receiving Feedback </h3>
					<p>
						As of today, I actually haven't received any feedback on my pairing sessions, either because it wasn't rated yet, or it wasn't kind, specific, and actionable. So, I don't really know how I feel when receiving feedback, but I will just have to remember that if the feedback does have something negative, I shouldn't take it as an insult or as an obstacle but rather as an opportunity to work on something that could use improvement. 
					</p>
					<h3> Giving Feedback </h3>
					<p>
					I find that writing good feedback is extremely diffcult, mainly because it is hard to put in a form that will be useful to the other person. I try to at least include one thing that the other person could work on, just so that I'm not writing a bunch of useless information that can't actually be acted upon. It is pretty hard to write feedback that is kind, specific, and actionable because most of my sessions have gone very well and I haven't really had many issues to cover in my feedback. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>
					In general, I think that using pairing and feedback is a great way to learn programming and have loved doing the sessions so far. I believe it greatly improves my ability to express my thoughts and communicate effectively about programming concepts. I look forward to pairing in unit 2!

					<h2> March 22nd, 2014</h2>
					<p>When I think of the happiest I've ever been in my life, the values that come to mind would be: Achievement, Confidence, Creativity, Focus, and Self-respect. Mainly because the happiest I've ever been is after I achieve a major goal in my life, such as graduating high school and college. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>Of these values, I would say that confidence is the  most important to me primarily because it is the hardest for me to maintain, especially when facing challenges that test my knowledge, physical and emotional endurance, and willpower. When I am confident in myself, I find that most tasks are relatively easy to accomplish because I know that I will have the ability and tenacity to complete them, even if I make mistakes on the way. On the other hand, when I am not confident in my ability to do something, it is extremely difficult to make any progress at all because I am overtaken by the fear of failing and making mistakes. Confidence doesn't really come naturally for me, and (as weird as it seems) I sometimes have to trick myself into being confident in myself so that I can learn from my mistakes, instead of being so overwhelmed that I just quit and stop trying at all. 
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>
						In general, I try to live up to these values:
						</br>
						</br>
						Disagree 1---2---3---<strong style="background-color:red">4</strong>---5 Agree
						</br>
						</br>
						I gave myself a rating of 4 for maintaining these values because while I do my best to be confident in myself and remain focused on my goals, sometimes it is very hard to do.
					</p>
				</br>
					<p>
						The last topic that somebody asked me for advice on was hardware for building a custom computer. I have built several computers for myself and friends which all ended up working great, so most of my friends ask me for advice on this subject.

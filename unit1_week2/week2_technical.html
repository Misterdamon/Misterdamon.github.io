					<h2> Why is Javascript so popular?</h2>
						<p>
						Javascript is popular in web development for a variety of reasons, and I'll try to explain why!
						</p>
							<h4>Easy to use and learn</h4>
								<p>
									Javascript is extremely easy to learn and doesn't require too much previous knowledge of programming to get into. It also has a very active community, so help is never far away if you need it. In addition, debugging Javascript is much easier than other languages, which ultimately makes it easier to use.
								</p>
							<h4>Javascript is <em>flexible.</em></h4>
								<p>
								Javascript is very flexible when it comes to web development, it can be used client-side (in the browser), as well as server-side (with node.js). It supports functional programming, as well as object-oriented programming and inheritance. Javascript works in all major browsers so it can be used pretty much universally. 
								</br>
								</br>
								Another major advantage of Javascript is its wide range of libraries and tools for web development, such as jQuery, which aids in manipulating the Document-Object Model. If you need to do something done for your web page, chances are there is a library or framework that can help you achieve your goals.
								</p>
							<h4> Javascript is <strong>fast</strong> and responsive.</h4>
								<p>
									Javascript is fast, which means that it ultimately speeds up load times of web pages because the script is run in the browser and does not need to communicate with a server. Since much of web development is about user experience, Javascript makes it much easier to enable user interaction in a way that (usually) does not bog down site performance. Since most devices support Javascript, support for multiple devices and screen sizes is more easily accomplished.
									</br>
									</br>
									Another major feature of why Javascript is so popular is AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML). AJAX enables your webpages to request information from a server without having to leave or reload the page, which as you can imagine, makes user experience and overall page interaction much more enjoyable.

        <h2>Why pair-programming?</h2>
          <ul id="goals_list">
            <li>
              helps <span class="bolder">structuring</span> the code, laying out the <em>design</em> before 
              starting
            </li>
            <li>
              improves <span class="bolder">readability</span> and allows both programmers to contribute 
              in a meaningful way
            </li>
            <li>reduces amount of <span class="emphasize">errors</span></li>
            <li>more fun finding <span class="emphasize">good</span> solutions</li>

      <h2>About pair-programing</h2>
        <p>
          It means working together on a single project and 
          finding the best solutions by discussion. The code will have 
          less errors because 2 pairs of eyes are both looking and checking 
          the same code. It also means mentoring and helping each other 
          to proceed.
        </p>

          <h3>Driver</h3>
            <p>The driver is the person doing the programming.</p>
          <h3>Navigator</h3>
            <p>The navigator directs the flow of the program and helps the driver
                to proceed.
            </p>

        <h2>Pair reflection</h2>
          <p>Our first pairing was very enjoyable and we worked very well together. 
             We didn't know quite what to expect for our first session 
             but our work seemed more like a conversation than anything else. 
             We helped each other and together managed to agree on how to proceed 
             quite easily. 
          </p>
          <p> We also took turns as driver and navigator and 
              if felt like each person had an equal part in the overall structure of
              the program. We both feel that we can improve on describing what we want
              to do and which parts of the program we are actually looking at so that our pair
              could more easily understand and follow.

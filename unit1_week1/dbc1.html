		<h3 class="underline"> Why I wanted to join Dev Bootcamp</h3>
			<p id = "why_dbc">I wanted to join DBC because it provides an environment that I felt was extremely well-suited to my style of learning and would teach me to be the developer that I had always wanted to be. If phase 0 is any indication of how the on-site program is going to be, then I am even more ecstatic that I decided to attend.

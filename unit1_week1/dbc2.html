	<p> This is my first attempt at making a website that looks relatively good, and has the proper formatting. </p>
	<h1> My name is Jacob Persing </h1>
			<p>I currently live in San Jose, CA, and just graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Comparative Literature. I love to play video games and learn about technology and how it works. I cannot wait to start Dev Bootcamp!
			</p>
		
		<h2 class="underline"> Interest facts about me </h2>
			<ul class="unordered">
				<li>I am one of 8 children</li>
				<li>I have two cats, named <strong>Spencer</strong> and <strong>Meowmeow</strong>. (Real creative, I know)
				</li>
				<li>I used to be on a rowing team. (emphasis on <em>used to</em>, because I am definitely out of shape now)</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 class="underline"> My favorite things to do!</h2>
			<ol class = "ordered">
				<li> Play video games.</li>
				<li> Learn to code. </li>
				<li> Hang out with my gigantic family</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h3 class="underline"> Why I wanted to join Dev Bootcamp</h3>
			<p id = "why_dbc">I wanted to join DBC because it provides an environment that I felt was extremely well-suited to my style of learning and would teach me to be the developer that I had always wanted to be. If phase 0 is any indication of how the on-site program is going to be, then I am even more ecstatic that I decided to attend.

	<h2>My favorite websites and how I would rate them in terms of user experience and design. 
	</h2>
</header>

	<p> My three favorite websites are reddit.com, lumosity.com, and techcrunch.com and I'll explain why!</p>

	<h3>reddit.com</h3>
		<p> I love reddit because it is really easy to get lost in the links and enjoy the content. From a user experience perspective, it is rather easy to use and navigate through because the layout and organization is very simple. However, it is quite plain and uninteresting, and sometimes it feels like it could use a bit more visual styling just to spice things up. The content itself is entertaining most of the time but sometimes it can get really innappropriate just because most people are anonymous on the site, and can say whatever they want. While it is very difficult to find a specific article or post, it is easy to find interesting posts in any category on the site. After being on the site for a while it can often feel like you've wasted alot of time, but I can guarantee that it is never boring and I find it very entertaining.

	<h3> lumosity.com </h3>
		<p> I love lumosity because I genuinely enjoy playing the games on the site and feel like it actually has made a difference in my memory, attention, and problem solving ability. The site is very visually appealing and is organized very well, but because of the way the games are designed, the site is primarily optimized for desktop use with a keyboard and mouse. I like the way it presents your scores and training history on the home page and makes navigating between pages very simple. Generally each session of lumosity only takes about 15 minutes, so I never really feel tired or bored after doing my daily training, but I'm sure that if played for too long I would start to lose interest. I started lumosity as a trial version but eventually ended up paying for it because I liked the way the site was set up and the content was very appealing. Plus, nobody can complain about having a faster, more efficient brain!

	<h3> techcrunch.com </h3>
		<p> techcrunch is one of my favorite websites because it always keeps me up-to-date with interesting advancements in technology and provides at least some explanation of how they work. When I first look at the site I am immediately drawn to the "latest" news feed which shows articles on technology and its applications. Overall the site is visually appealing and I like the neutral color scheme because it is less distracting. Yet, the advertisements are often very ostentatious and annoying, but I can't really complain too much because the content is my main focus. It is very simple to navigate between pages and categories, and the site itself is responsive and always works on any of my devices.

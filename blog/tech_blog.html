				<h2> Computer Memory! </h2>

				<p> Hello everyone! </p>

				<p>	So this time I'm going to take a crack at explaining what computer memory is, why it is used, and the different types that are used. In the most basic sense, memory is just a medium that is used to store information that the computer will then reference later. However, there are several different types of memory that are each used for different purposes that work to make the computer faster and more efficient when processing information. The main goal of memory is to provide the CPU with information constantly, so that it does not have to stop and wait for information to be sent from a storage medium. Below, I'll be going through the main types of memory and their role in computing.</p>

				<p> Essentially, memory is a way for the CPU to constantly have access to the data it needs that uses a strict hierarchy system based on how fast the CPU can physically obtain information in memory. The first step in this hierarchy is the cache. Caches are a form of memory that store the information most often used by the CPU in a place that is right next to it, which facilitates faster processing. Storing the information most used by the CPU on a cache greatly reduces the time needed to access this information and speeds up processing time. A typical computer has two levels of cache that perform in this way.</p>

				<p> The next type of memory is RAM (Random Access Memory), which most of you have probably heard of. RAM is another way of storing information that the CPU will need, but it is generally much, much larger than the CPU cache. Whenever you load a program, the essential portions of that program are loaded from the hard disk into RAM because this way the CPU can quickly access the information because it is stored closer to the CPU. In RAM, information is stored sequentially in blocks, which then can be accessed by the CPU because it expects the information to be stored in order. </p>

				<p> The last type of memory that I'm covering today is the permanent storage memory. One type of permanent storage is a hard drive, which stores information on a disk which can then be accessed later, the only problem with hard drives is that they can be quite slow at reading and relaying information to the CPU. This is why RAM and caches are so much better for CPU speed because they are faster at relaying information. So let's say you have a game installed on your hard drive, when you load that game, the computer is taken essential application information from your hard drive and loading it into RAM so that the CPU can more easily access it. As you play the game, if more information is required from the hard drive, the program will add it to the ram as needed. After you close the application, all information that the CPU needed for that specific application is purged so that more space is free for other operations. </p>

				<p> Well I hope you all understand computer memory a bit better now! I know I do, I can't wait to meet the rest of you on Monday! </p>

				<h2> Recursion, recursion, recursion... </h2>
					<p> Hey everyone! </p>
					<p> Well this time I'm going to be trying to explain how recursion works, and why it is useful in programming. It can be a bit hard to grasp how recursion works at first, but with a little practice it becomes more obvious. First, every recursive algorithm has a base case that it works toward, and must eventually reach this base case or else it will go on forever. Here's an example of of a recursive method: </br> </br>
			
					<span>def countdown(n) </br>
					  return if n == 0 </br>
					  countdown(n-1) </br>
					end </br> </br>
					
					countdown(10)
					</span>
					</p>

					<p> So for this example, the method definition includes another call to itself but with a parameter one less than the original value. So each time the method is called, it is called with its parameter being one less than it was the last time around. So the output for this program would be: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 if we had output it to the console. If we had forgotten about changing the parameter in the second call, this method would keep calling itself with the same parameter and it would just keep repeating "10" forever because it is not getting closer to the base case. </p>

					<p> So in every case, a recursive method must ALWAYS have a base case that will allow the method to exit based on that condition. Much like a loop, without the right conditional exit, it will run forever. Even though this was a very simple example, I feel like it does a good job of illuminating how recursion works on a basic level. Anyways, I hope you guys learned something new! I know I did. </p>

				<h2> SQL Injection </h2>
					<p> Hey guys! </p> </br>
					<p> Today I'm taking a crack at explaining SQL injection, including what it is, why it is a problem, and how to avoid it. From what I've been reading, it seems as though SQL Injection is a common problem that is easily avoidable, but entirely too common at the same time. First, let me explain what it is. SQL Injection (SQLI) is a database attack that exploits a site or application that uses dynamic queries that utilize user input. SQL injection is the practice of inserting SQL statements through user input, and they can be catastrophic. An attacker can delete/modify/copy contents of a database simply by inserting a harmful SQL statement to the database. Depending on the vulnerability of the site being attacked, a hacker would be able to gain access to sensitive database information, including usernames, passwords, etc... 
					</p>
					<p> In terms of difficulty, SQL injection is one of the simplest to perform because of a few key reasons: 1) SQL injection vulnerabilities are extremely common, and hackers find targets by scanning websites for these vulnerabilities, and often choose their targets by the attractiveness of the data contained in the databases. (i.e. usernames, passwords, credit card info, etc...) 2) The hack procedure is well-documented and there are many resources that hackers can use to figure out how to perform an SQL injection. Furthermore, data extraction is not the only danger of an SQL attack, a hacker can actually change lots of site information, including replacing the home screen of a site with a malicious version of it, or can even shut down the host server. 
					</p>

					<p> In general, SQL injection should not be a problem for many sites because it is rather easy to avoid. Some strategies include parameterized queries, stored procedures, and escaping user input. First, parameterized queries protect databases by defining all SQL logic beforehand, and using parameters to set the different arguments for the SQL, so that even if a hacker tried to inject SQL, it would not work because now the site knows the difference between data and code, no matter what user input is supplied. Next, stored procedures are defined and stored inside the database itself, and then called from the application so that a user cannot alter any SQL statements. Another method for avoiding SQL injection is to escape all user input by using an escaping scheme in your database; this way, the application is able to tell between user input and the SQL statements supplied by the developer. 
					</p>

					<p> Well, hopefully you guys understand SQL injection a bit better now! Thanks for your time and I'll see you guys in a few weeks for the on-site portion! </p>

				<h2> Object-Oriented vs. Functional Programming </h2>
				<p> Hello world! </br> </p>

				<p> Today I'm covering the differences between object-oriented and functional programming, and I'll do my best to explain what the differences are and why we use them for different purposes. First off, object-oriented programming (OOP) is the practice of programming with respect to 'objects'. Objects in OOP are generally considered to be instances of classes that can be manipulated by methods inside them; yet, in a broader scheme, an object can be any variable, function, or data that takes up space in memory. In my opinion, the main goal of OOP is the modularization and reusability of code that you write, which can then be incorporated into later implementations of that code. So, OOP is best used when you have a bunch of "things" that also have a set of operations that can be performed on those "things". In general, OOP can make code more readable by encapsulating functions and "moving parts" into different areas. </p>

				<p> Functional programming, on the other hand, has data and functions that tend to have more in common with one another, but their algorithms are defined more in terms of recursion and composition rather than iterating through data with loops. Functional programming is good when you want to minimize the amount of "moving parts" i.e. functions/methods that have to do with the data that you are dealing with. For example, Haskell is a language where all 'objects' are essentially immutable, and any time you want to make a new instance of an object (or modify one), you basically copy the object over and retain the parts that you want to keep while keeping references to the unchanged portions. One other major aspect of functional programming is the use of higher-order functions, which have the ability to take a function as an argument or return a function as an output. 
				</p>

				<p> Well, hopefully this may have cleared up a small amount of confusion that you may have had with functional and object-oriented programming. I'll see you guys next week for my technical post! </p>

				<h2> Ruby Classes - When, why and how to use them </h2>
				<p> Salutations, friends! </p>
				<p> So today I'm covering classes in Ruby, and will do my best to explain why we use them and how to implement them. First, classes are an important part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that let us determine how to structure the data of our programs, and which methods have access to that data. Lets say, for instance, that we have a class definition like so: </br></br>
				<span>
					class MyAwesomeClass </br>
						def initialize(parameter)</br>
							@parameter = parameter</br>
					  end</br></br>

					  def say_hello</br>
					  	puts @parameter</br>
					  end</br>
					end</br>

					my_class = MyAwesomeClass.new("foo")</br>
					my_class.say_hello</br>
					your_class = MyAwesomeClass.new("bar")</br>
					your_class.say_hello</br>

				</span> </br> </p>
				<p> Using this example, I'll try to explain why classes are useful for organizing program architecture and data encapsulation. Every time we declare a new instance of MyAwesomeClass, each instance will possess a method that intializes it based on the argument given, as well as a method called say_hello, which outputs the @parameter that I have given it. So on the last few lines of the example, I created an instance of MyAwesomeClass with the argument "foo", and assigned it to the variable "my_class". I did the same with the variable "your_class" but instead initialized it with the value "bar". Every instance of the class will have the same methods available to it, but the data contained in the class may be different based on the argument given in initialization. </p>

				<p>In our example, the class method, "say_hello" accesses the instance variable, "@parameter" without having it passed in as an argument to the method. It can do this because with classes, an instance variable is accessible from anywhere within the class, or by any method within the class. So when we call say_hello on my_class, the output would be "foo" which is printed to the console; however, when we call say_hello on your_class, the output is "bar". This is because the different instances of the classes were initialized with different values.</p>

				<p> Well, this is just a taste of what classes can do in Ruby, hopefully you all learned a little bit about implementing them, and why to implement them. So reiterate, classes are an important part of OOP because they allow us to organize our objects in a meaningful way, and allow us to manipulate objects based on what we want to do. That's all for today, good luck and happy coding! </p>

				<h2> Enumerable#cycle - How and When to use it </h2>
				<p> Hello! </p> </br> <p>Today's subject is the Ruby enumerable function: cycle. I'll do my best to explain what it is, and how and when to use it in a program. Basically, cycle is a function that will cycle through (no way! I never would have guessed :D) the object that it is called on based on the parameters that you give it. Cycle is best used when you have an object that needs to be iterated through, and you know exactly how many times you need to cycle through it. So lets say you have something like: </br></br>
				<span>
					[1,2,3].cycle do |x| </br>
						puts x </br>
					end
				</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				This code calls the block between do and end on each element in our [1,2,3] array. However, without passing in an argument to cycle, this code will also just repeat <span> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 </span> forever because we didn't specify how many times to cycle. </br></br>
				So What happens when we pass an argument into cycle? Lets find out: </br></br>
				<span>[2,3,4,5].cycle(3) do |x| </br>
					puts x * x </br>
				end </br></br>
				</span>
				Since we passed a 3 in to our cycle function, it now knows how many times to iterate through each value in our array. So the resulting output would be:
				<span> 4 9 16 25 4 9 16 25 4 9 16 25 </span>. While there are many other ways to accomplish this same task in ruby, cycle() is merely just one method completing it. It is similar to the #times loop except for that times does not automatically iterate through the object it is called on. 
				</p>
				<p> Well, hopefully that clarified things just a little bit for you guys, and hopefully you learned something new about the Enumerable function: cycle(). I hadn't previously used this function, so I certainly learned a lot from this!

					<h2> Arrays vs. Hashes - When to use them and why </h2>
					<p> Hey everyone, </br> </br> I'd like to take a moment to talk about Hashes and Arrays in Ruby programming. I'll do my best to explain what they are, and when and why we use them in programming. First, let me explain what they are. Arrays and Hashes are indexed data structures that keep track of information by storing it in a way that can be accessed by a certain index value. 
					<h3>Arrays</h3>
					With Arrays, this index is an integer value, and if you wanted to access a certain element in the array, all you would have to do is put in the specific numeric index that element. In general, you would use an array to store information that you want to be ordered with integer indices, for example, if you had an bunch of test scores that you wanted to store and manipulate and didn't care about which score belonged to which person. Arrays are generally less efficient than Hashes because in order to access a value, you much iterate sequentially across all elements in the array, whereas with a hash you only need to iterate until you reach the element that you are looking for. 
					</p>
					<h3>Hashes </h3>
					<p>
						In Ruby, hashes are collections of data that are stored based on key/value pairs, where the key is the index by which the elements are accessed. The key can be any type of object, instead of just an integer, as is the case with arrays. In comparison, Hashes are more efficient than arrays because looking up values is much faster when you don't have to search through each value in the data structure just to find the value you were looking for. Hashes are best used when you have a large collection of data that you want to be ordered in a particular way. For example, if you wanted to store the data for an address, you could make a hash key with a string "address" and store the address as the corresponding value for that key. This makes it much easier to understand than if you only had an integer value to tell you where you data is, like in an array.

					<h2> Why is Javascript so popular?</h2>
						<p>
						Javascript is popular in web development for a variety of reasons, and I'll try to explain why!
						</p>
							<h4>Easy to use and learn</h4>
								<p>
									Javascript is extremely easy to learn and doesn't require too much previous knowledge of programming to get into. It also has a very active community, so help is never far away if you need it. In addition, debugging Javascript is much easier than other languages, which ultimately makes it easier to use.
								</p>
							<h4>Javascript is <em>flexible.</em></h4>
								<p>
								Javascript is very flexible when it comes to web development, it can be used client-side (in the browser), as well as server-side (with node.js). It supports functional programming, as well as object-oriented programming and inheritance. Javascript works in all major browsers so it can be used pretty much universally. 
								</br>
								</br>
								Another major advantage of Javascript is its wide range of libraries and tools for web development, such as jQuery, which aids in manipulating the Document-Object Model. If you need to do something done for your web page, chances are there is a library or framework that can help you achieve your goals.
								</p>
							<h4> Javascript is <strong>fast</strong> and responsive.</h4>
								<p>
									Javascript is fast, which means that it ultimately speeds up load times of web pages because the script is run in the browser and does not need to communicate with a server. Since much of web development is about user experience, Javascript makes it much easier to enable user interaction in a way that (usually) does not bog down site performance. Since most devices support Javascript, support for multiple devices and screen sizes is more easily accomplished.
									</br>
									</br>
									Another major feature of why Javascript is so popular is AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML). AJAX enables your webpages to request information from a server without having to leave or reload the page, which as you can imagine, makes user experience and overall page interaction much more enjoyable.
